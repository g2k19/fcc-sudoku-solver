# fcc - "Sudoku Solver" Project
Note: This repo contains at the moment only the files that needed to be worked on, not the full project to run.

More information about the actual project can be found on [freeCodeCamp's website](https://www.freecodecamp.org) under the Quality Assurance section of the Cirriculum.
